# Search-Project
In this project, I recreate this phenomenal technological development by using the map and set abstractions to build a document search engine that can find matching pages for a user's query with lightning-fast response time. This is a simplified version of the technology underpinning Spotlight, Google, Bing, and every other modern search engine.
